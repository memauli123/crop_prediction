Overview:

This project is a FastAPI-based Crop Prediction API that uses machine learning models to predict the best crop based on soil nutrients, pH, and weather conditions. The API takes inputs such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, pH value, state, district, and month, then predicts the most suitable crop.

Features:

1. FastAPI Framework: High-performance, asynchronous web framework.

2. Machine Learning Integration: Uses predictive models for crop recommendation.

3. CORS Middleware: Enables cross-origin resource sharing.

4. RESTful API: Exposes endpoints for making predictions.

API Endpoints:

Technologies Used:

1.Python 3.10

2.FastAPI

3.Pydantic

4.Uvicorn

5.Machine Learning Models (for predictions)
